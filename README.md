   Project Overview: File Operations (Read, Write, Modify)
![Screenshot 2025-01-09 200337](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8ebdb09-2b04-486a-bbff-a480b90a40e9)


1.Objective:
  The File Operations Project is a simple console-based application that allows users to perform basic file operations: reading, writing, and modifying files. The project is implemented in Java and provides a 
  menu-based interface for the user to interact with files. It allows users to create a file, write data to it, modify the content, and read the file's content.

  Key Features:
  Write to a File:

  Allows users to input text and write it to a specified file.
  The user can type multiple lines of text, and the program writes them into the file. The writing stops when the user types exit.
  Read from a File:

 Reads and displays the content of an existing file.
 If the file doesn't exist, the program asks whether the user wants to create it.
 Modify a File:

 Allows users to overwrite the entire content of an existing file with new text.
 Like the write operation, the user can type lines of text, and the program writes them to the file.
 File Existence Check:

 Before reading a file, the program checks if the file exists.
 If the file doesn't exist, the user is prompted to create it.
 User-Friendly Interface:

  A simple text-based interface with clear instructions.
  The user selects an option (write, read, modify, exit) through a menu-driven system.
2.Technologies Used:
  Programming Language: Java
  File I/O: FileReader, BufferedReader, FileWriter, BufferedWriter
  Input Handling: Scanner for user input
  Functionality Overview:
   Menu: The program presents the following options to the user:

Option 1: Write text to a file.
Option 2: Read content from a file.
Option 3: Modify content of a file.
Option 4: Exit the program.
Write to File:

Prompts the user to enter the file name.
Allows the user to input lines of text.
Saves the text in the file until the user types exit.
Read from File:

Prompts the user to enter the file name.
If the file exists, it reads and displays the content.
If the file does not exist, the program offers to create it.
Modify File:

Prompts the user to enter the file name.
Allows the user to overwrite the entire file content with new text.
Exit: Terminates the program.

3.Example Workflow:
  Start the Program: The user is presented with a menu of options.


Copy code
1. Write to a file
2. Read from a file
3. Modify a file
4. Exit
Choose Write Option:

User selects Option 1 and provides the file name (e.g., example.txt).
The user inputs text, and the program writes it to example.txt.
Choose Read Option:

User selects Option 2 to read the contents of example.txt.
If the file exists, the program displays its content.
If the file doesn't exist, the program prompts the user to create it.
Choose Modify Option:

User selects Option 3 to overwrite the content of example.txt.
The user provides new content, and the program writes it to the file.
Sample Output:
plaintext

File Operations: Read, Write, Modify
1. Write to a file
2. Read from a file
3. Modify a file
4. Exit
Choose an option (1-4): 1
Enter the file name to write to: example.txt
Enter text to write to the file (type 'exit' on a new line to finish):
This is a test line.
This is another test line.
exit
Content written to example.txt

 File Operations: Read, Write, Modify
1. Write to a file
2. Read from a file
3. Modify a file
4. Exit
 Choose an option (1-4): 2
 Enter the file name to read from: example.txt
 Content of example.txt:
 This is a test line.
 This is another test line.
4.Future Improvements:
 Error Handling: Improved error handling for cases like insufficient permissions to write to a file.
 File Path Options: Allow users to specify file paths instead of only file names.
 File Operations Logging: Track and log the actions performed on files for audit purposes.
 Graphical User Interface (GUI): Build a graphical interface to replace the console-based input/output.
5.Conclusion :: This project offers a simple introduction to file operations in Java and provides basic functionality for reading, writing, and modifying text files. The menu-driven interface ensures that users 
                can easily interact with the program to perform different file operations.
